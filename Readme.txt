The concept is hidden connection between 2 devices.

1. Create a free php site online and host shadow-server (it just acts as proxy)
2. Create client and sockets with lib.(act as client and server or p2p)

demo chat application, it is not that responsive but working concept.

just a privacy concept as the server and client both run on client side. encryption can be added.
